        <h3>Our Product</h3>
        <p>
            Overseeing soil moisture levels accurately through irrigation systems 
            is essential to increasing crop yield and preserving water. By accounting 
            for soil moisture variability, farmers will be able to manage their irrigation 
            systems better to utilize the necessary amount of water at the right time. 
            By precisely scheduling the irrigation systems, our product can help avoid under or over watering. 
            In order to do so, our product utilizes capacitance-based soil moisture sensors. 
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top:10px">
            Our product proposes an innovative approach to conserve water by carefully measuring 
            the amount of moisture in the soil, and activating precisely timed solenoid valves to keep the 
            soil at its optimal moisture levels for the given corn crop to produce the max yield. In our prototype, 
            we are proposing a solution for a farmer who grows corn crops, and this technology will decrease water utilization, 
            and at the same time, it would help increase crop yield. Our product will also take into account the variability 
            of water consumption based on the soil type, crop type, weather conditions, and stage of growth of the crop 
            because these are all important influencing factors that contribute to the quality of corn production.

        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>
            Pre-existing Drip Irrigation System: A drip irrigation system includes drip lines in rows of 300 - 600 feet. 
            Drip lines are often spaced 12 - 18 inches from each other. The emitters, spaced 6 - 12 inches, in the drip 
            lines are where the water exits out into the field. In the case of our prototype, we are modeling our product 
            based on a system that has drip lines spaced 12 inches apart, and emitters spaced 12 inches apart as well. 
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top:10px">
            Capacitive Moisture Sensors: The 16 sensors have a detection radius of 4.1 cm, and they are able to work by sensing 
            the change in capacitance due to moisture in the soil. This sensor is more durable than traditional resistive moisture 
            sensors because it is less prone to corrosion.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top:10px">
            Solenoid Valves: The 4 plastic water solenoid valves have an operational voltage of 12V, but they can stretch to 
            running on as low as 6V. This makes them good to use on spaced-out fields. They have two ½” nominal non-taped national 
            pipe outlets.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top:10px">
            Arduino Mega: This microcontroller receives data from the moisture sensors in the field, and it then determines 
            if the soil is wet/dry based off of the data. If the sensors read dry, the Arduino will signal the solenoid valves 
            to turn water on to the corresponding drip lines. Because this microcontroller has 16 analog pins, we are utilizing 
            each one so that we have a total of 16 capacitive moisture sensors being controlled by it. 
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top:10px">
            Enclosure: This serves as a housing for the Arduino Mega, and it is made out of sheet metal. It has vents to allow 
            for aeration and to prevent condensation from collecting inside the enclosure. It also has countersink emboss for mounting.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top:10px">
            Growth Phase Cycle Software: Our product comes with a web application in which farmers can update which cycle of 
            growth their crop is in. The hardware will adjust how sensitive the system should be to moisture to give the correct 
            amount of water for that phase.

        <h3>Why Us?</h3>
        <p>
            Our team aspires to create a precise automation mechanism for drip irrigation systems 
            in order to conserve freshwater and increase corn crop yields, thus we work diligently 
            to bring this dream into fruition. We also prioritize a user-friendly interface, because 
            we know that it is intimidating to have to sift through a handful of numeral readings from 
            the moisture sensors and try to make sense of it. This is why our team has poured a lot of 
            effort into creating a web application that makes access to your field data easy to read. 
            We also trust our farmers working diligently in the fields every day, and understand that 
            no one knows the ins and outs of corn better than they do. This is why we are putting the 
            controls in their hands for deciding what growth stage their corn crops are in, and they will 
            have easy access to updating that information on the web application.
